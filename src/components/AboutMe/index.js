            <p className="mx-6 my-4 mt-8 indent-[36px]">Hi! I'm a homemaker who recently took a big step toward building a career in tech. I'm currently studying <span className="font-bold text-[#B4ADA3] text-[20px]">Frontend Development</span> through a vocational course,
                 where I'm learning how to create websites using <span  className="font-bold text-[#B4ADA3] text-[20px]"> HTML, CSS, JavaScript,</span> and starting to explore tools like <span className="font-bold text-[#B4ADA3] text-[20px]">React and Git</span>.</p>

            <p className="mx-6 my-4 indent-[36px]">This new journey has been exciting and challenging, and I'm really enjoying the process of learning and building things from scratch. 
                I'm now looking for a <span className="font-bold text-[#B4ADA3] text-[20px]">Live Industry Apprenticeship (LIA)</span> where I can gain hands-on experience, learn from real projects, and grow as a frontend developer.</p>

            <p className="mx-6 my-4 indent-[36px]">Being a full-time homemaker has helped me develop strong skills in <span className="font-bold text-[#B4ADA3] text-[20px]">time management, problem-solving, adaptability,</span> and
             <span className="font-bold text-[#B4ADA3] text-[20px]"> communication</span> â€”all of which I believe are just as important in a tech role.</p>

            <p className="mx-6 my-4 indent-[36px]">I'm passionate about creating clean, user-friendly designs, and I'm always open to learning and improving. I'm excited to start this new chapter and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>
